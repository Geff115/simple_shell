The Simple Shell project.
In the course of this project, all our files are compiled using gcc.
With -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 as flags for our gcc compiler.
We didn't use any global variable.
We use only the allowed system calls and functions, as stated in the project requirements.
We checked for memory leaks in all cases, and ensured no leaks were  recorded.
We ensured all our header files are #include guarded.
All our codes followed the betty style implementation.
